# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Date**: January 20, 2024
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Choosing the technology stack for ChatFlow

## Decision

We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State**: React Query + Zustand
- **Real-time**: Socket.io Client

### Backend
- **API**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Drizzle
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js
- **Real-time**: Socket.io Server

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Database**: Neon (Serverless Postgres)
- **File Storage**: Uploadthing
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics

## Rationale

### Why Next.js 14?
- Latest stable version with App Router
- Built-in API routes
- Excellent performance
- Great DX with hot reload
- Server Components for better performance

### Why TypeScript?
- Type safety prevents bugs
- Better IDE support
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring

### Why Tailwind CSS?
- Rapid development
- Consistent design system
- Mobile-first approach
- Small bundle size
- Easy theming

### Why PostgreSQL?
- Robust and reliable
- JSONB for flexible data
- Full-text search capability
- Strong consistency
- Excellent performance

### Why Socket.io?
- Battle-tested real-time library
- Automatic reconnection
- Room support built-in
- Falls back gracefully
- Good documentation

### Why Drizzle?
- Type-safe queries
- Lightweight
- Great DX
- Good performance
- Migration support

## Alternatives Considered

### Supabase vs Custom Backend
- Supabase is great but adds complexity
- Custom gives more control
- Can migrate later if needed

### Prisma vs Drizzle
- Prisma is heavier
- Drizzle has better performance
- Drizzle's API is simpler

### CSS-in-JS vs Tailwind
- CSS-in-JS adds runtime overhead
- Tailwind is faster
- Tailwind enforces consistency

### tRPC vs REST API
- tRPC is excellent but adds complexity
- REST is simpler for this use case
- Can add tRPC later if needed

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fast development speed
- Type safety throughout
- Excellent performance
- Great developer experience
- Easy deployment

### Negative
- Need to learn Drizzle (if unfamiliar)
- Tailwind has learning curve
- Socket.io adds complexity
- Vendor lock-in with Vercel

### Mitigation
- Drizzle docs are good
- Tailwind docs are excellent
- Socket.io patterns well documented
- Can self-host if needed

## Implementation Notes

1. Start with Next.js setup
2. Add TypeScript strict mode
3. Configure Tailwind with design tokens
4. Set up Drizzle with migrations
5. Implement Socket.io server
6. Add monitoring early
