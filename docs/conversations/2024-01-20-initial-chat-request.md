## User Request

**User**: I want to add a group chat, public chat room feature to my app

## AI Discovery Process

**AI**: I'd love to help you build a group chat feature! Let me understand your vision better.

First, let's talk about the chat rooms themselves:
- Should users be able to create their own chat rooms?
- Do you want both public rooms (anyone can join) and private rooms (invite-only)?
- Any specific inspiration - like Discord, Slack, or WhatsApp groups?

**User**: Yeah I was thinking like Discord but simpler. Users can create rooms, some public some private

**AI**: Great! Discord-style but simplified. Let me refine this:

For public rooms:
- Should they be discoverable through search/browse?
- Categories or tags to organize them?
- Member limits?

For private rooms:
- Invite via link or user selection?
- Admin/moderator roles?

**User**: Definitely searchable public rooms. Maybe categories like 'Gaming', 'Study Groups', etc. Private rooms just need invite links

**AI**: Perfect! Now let's talk about the chat experience itself:

Inside a chat room, what features are essential?
- Text messages only, or also images/files?
- Reactions/emojis on messages?
- Delete/edit own messages?
- See who's online?
- @mentions to notify specific users?

**User**: Text and images for sure. Reactions would be cool. And yeah showing who's online is important

**AI**: Excellent! A few more questions to nail down the experience:

For images:
- Max file size? Compression?
- Thumbnail previews in chat?
- Full-screen viewer?

For online presence:
- Show in member list only or also "typing..." indicators?
- Last seen times?

What about notifications?
- Push notifications for all messages or just @mentions?
- Mute room option?

**User**: Keep it simple - just thumbnails that open full screen. Show typing indicators. And yeah, let people mute rooms they don't want notifications from

## Requirements Extracted

**AI**: Based on our conversation, here's what we're building:

### Group Chat Feature Summary:
- ✅ Discord-inspired but simplified
- ✅ Public rooms (searchable, categorized)
- ✅ Private rooms (invite via link)
- ✅ Text + image messages
- ✅ Message reactions
- ✅ Online presence + typing indicators
- ✅ Mutable notifications

### Hidden Requirements Discovered:

**User**: Oh wait, what about when users leave? And spam?

**AI**: Excellent questions! These are critical for a chat system. Let me explore both:

When users leave:
- Keep their messages but show "[Deleted User]"?
- Remove all their messages?
- Transfer room ownership if they created it?

For spam/moderation:
- Auto-detect spam/inappropriate content?
- Report message feature?
- Room moderators who can delete/ban?
- Global admins vs room admins?

**User**: Keep messages but anonymize. And yeah we need moderators who can delete messages and ban people from rooms

## Final Specification

Based on this conversation, the following specification files were generated:
- `/specs/features/group-chat.yaml`
- `/specs/pages/chat-room.yaml`
- `/specs/pages/chat-list.yaml`
- `/specs/components/message-bubble.yaml`

The visual mockups were updated to reflect:
- Moderation controls
- User role indicators
- Report functionality
- Ban management interface

This conversation demonstrates how natural language requirements evolve into comprehensive specifications through iterative refinement.
