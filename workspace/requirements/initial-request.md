# Initial Requirements

## What I Want to Build

I need a chat application for my community. Something like Discord but not as complicated. 

### Must Have:
- Group chat rooms
- Some rooms public, some private
- Real-time messaging (no refresh needed)
- Share images in chat
- See who's online

### Nice to Have:
- Reactions to messages (like thumbs up)
- Categories for rooms
- Typing indicators
- Moderator controls

### Inspiration:
- Discord - but simpler
- WhatsApp groups - but for desktop too
- Slack - but more casual/fun

### Users:
- Expecting 100-500 users initially
- Mostly young adults (18-35)
- Mix of mobile and desktop users

### Technical Preferences:
- Modern tech stack
- Should work on phones
- Fast and responsive
- Easy to maintain

### What I Don't Need:
- Voice/video chat
- File sharing (just images)
- Bots or integrations
- Paid features

## My Concerns:
- Spam and inappropriate content
- Performance with many users
- Making it look professional
- Keeping it simple to use
