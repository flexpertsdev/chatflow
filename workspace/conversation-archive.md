# ChatFlow Development Conversation Archive

## Initial Request (January 15, 2024)

**User**: I want to build a chat app like Discord but simpler. Just group chats, not all the voice stuff.

**AI**: I'll help you build a simplified Discord-like chat application focused on group text chat. Let me understand your requirements better:

1. Do you want public chat rooms that anyone can join?
2. Should users be able to create their own rooms?
3. What about private/invite-only rooms?
4. Any moderation features needed?

**User**: Yes to all! Public and private rooms. Room owners can make mods. Need to handle spam/bad users.

## Feature Refinement (January 16, 2024)

**User**: Can we make it look modern? I like how WhatsApp looks but with Discord's organization

**AI**: Great combination! I'll design it with:
- WhatsApp's clean, mobile-first interface
- Discord's room/channel organization
- Modern, minimal aesthetic

Let me show you some initial mockups...

**User**: Love it! Can we add reactions to messages? And typing indicators?

**AI**: Absolutely! I'll add:
- üëç Emoji reactions (6 quick reactions + emoji picker)
- "User is typing..." indicators
- Message editing/deletion
- @mentions for notifications

## Technical Discussion (January 17, 2024)

**User**: How will the real-time stuff work? I don't want delays

**AI**: I'll implement real-time features using:

- Efficient event handling

Performance targets:

- Smooth typing indicators
- No lag on reactions

**User**: What about mobile? Most users will be on phones

**AI**: Mobile-first approach:
